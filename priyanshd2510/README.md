  It's the :white_circle:white team versus the :black_circle:black team.

  The turn starts by rolling 4 binary dice, which
  results in a number from 0 to 4. The current team gets to move one of their
  pieces by that many tiles.

  All of your pieces start on position 0 (the space just before tile 1). Your
  goal is to get all seven of them off the board by moving them onto position
  15 (the space just after tile 14). This is called **:rocket:ascending** a
  piece. You also want to prevent your opponent from :rocket:ascending their
  pieces.

  You will move your pieces along the tiles from tile 1 to tile 14. The tiles
  on your side of the board (tiles 1 through 4, 13, and 14) are safe ‚Äî only
  your pieces can be there. However, the tiles in the middle (tiles 5 through
  12) are unsafe ‚Äî your opponent's pieces can also be here. If one team's piece
  lands on the same tile as another team's piece, the piece that was landed on
  is **:crossed_swords:captured**! It goes all the way back to position 0.

  If you land on a **:rosette:rosette** (tiles 4, 8, and 14), your team gets to
  take another turn. Also, a piece that is on the :rosette:rosette on tile 8
  *cannot be :crossed_swords:captured*. A piece that's trying to capture it will
  simply bounce off onto tile 9.

  The first team to **:rocket:ascend** all seven of their pieces ‚Äî that is,
  move them off the board onto position 15 ‚Äî :crown:wins!

  Playing Ur on my GitHub profile is easy. The dice have already been rolled
  for you ‚Äî all you have to do is decide what to do with them.

  Anyone can join either team at any time, but once you're in a team, you're
  locked into it until the game ends. You can't play a move when it's the
  other team's turn.

  _([Before 2020-09-19](https://github.com/rossjrw/rossjrw/pull/133), your team
  was determined by your username. This is no longer the case.)_

  There will be a list of links below the board image with each possible move.
  Clicking one of those will take you to a page where you can create an Issue
  in this repository. The fields will already be filled in and all you have to
  do is click Submit.

  It will take a moment for Github Actions to acknowledge your move, but once
  it does, you'll see it react with the 'eyes' emoji (:eyes:). No more than a
  minute later it should react with the 'rocket' emoji (:rocket:) to let you
  know that your move was successful.

  If you don't see any of that, then something went wrong. Ping me in your
  issue by typing `cc @rossjrw`, and I'll take a look.

  Note that if your team has no possible moves ‚Äî for example by rolling a 0 ‚Äî
  your turn will be automatically skipped. The event log will let you know if
  this has happened.
